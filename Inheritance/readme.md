- protected : protected and public members of base class become protected in derived class, can be accessed in derived classes using member function.
- public    : protected and public members of base class become protected and public in derived class, can be accessed using objects of derived class
- friend    : a friend function is declared anywhere inside the class but defined outside it and it can access private members of that class as well.
